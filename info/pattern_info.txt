# Detects common SQL injection symbols:
# It is a single non-capturing group that checks for:
# (?i) → Case-insensitive
# - %27 = URL encoded single quote (')
# - '-- = Comment to ignore the rest of the SQL query
# - %23 or # = URL encoded or direct comment marker
# # (SQL comment)
(?i)(%27|'|--|%23|#)

# Detects use of OR/AND with always-true logic like: OR 1=1 or AND 1=1
# This is a classic SQL injection trick to bypass authentication
#\bOR\b / \bAND\b → Detects "OR" or "AND" as full words
#\s+ → Requires space after OR/AND
#\d+=\d+ → Looks for always-true condition (e.g., 1=1)
(?i)(\bOR\b|\bAND\b)\s+\d+=\d+

# Detects use of UNION SELECT which is often used to extract data from another table
# E.g., ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users
#UNION SELECT → Used to extract data from another table
(?i)UNION\s+SELECT

# Detects SELECT queries with a common typo (SELECT ... FORM instead of FROM)
# This may catch obfuscated or malformed injections
#SELECT.+FORM → Catches SELECT queries with typo "FORM" instead of "FROM"
(?i)SELECT.+FORM

# Detects INSERT INTO statements, used to insert malicious or unauthorized data
#INSERT INTO → Used to add data to a table
(?i)INSERT\s+INTO

# Detects DROP TABLE statements, which can delete database tables
# Very dangerous if executed
#DROP TABLE → Deletes a table
(?i)DROP\s+TABLE

# Detects UPDATE queries that try to change values in a table (like passwords or access levels)
#UPDATE <table> SET → Changes data in the table
(?i)UPDATE\s+\w+\s+SET

# Detects EXEC commands that can run stored procedures or system commands (e.g., xp_cmdshell)
#EXEC command → Executes stored procedures or commands
(?i)EXEC\s+\w+

# Detects WAITFOR DELAY used in time-based blind SQL injections
# E.g., WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'
#WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05' → Causes time delay
(?i)WAITFOR\s+DELAY

# Detects use of SLEEP(seconds) in SQL, another form of time delay attack
#SLEEP(5) → Pauses SQL execution for 5 seconds
(?i)SLEEP\(\d+\)
